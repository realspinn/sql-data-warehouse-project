# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! ðŸš€  
This project demonstrates a comprehensive end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solutionâ€”from building a scalable warehouse to delivering business-ready insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in **data engineering, ETL, data modeling, and analytics**.

---

## Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers):

- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data from ERP and CRM CSV files, loaded into a SQL Server database.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleanses, standardizes, and prepares the data for analysis.
- **Gold Layer**: Hosts the star schema with business-ready data for analytics and reporting.

---

## Project Overview

This project involves:

- **Modern Data Architecture** using SQL Server and Medallion layers.
- **ETL Pipelines** to extract, transform, and load data from source files.
- **Data Modeling** using star schema for performance and clarity.
- **SQL-based Reporting & Analytics** to extract meaningful business insights.

## Ideal For

This repository is an excellent reference for anyone looking to showcase skills in:

- SQL Development  
- Data Engineering  
- Data Warehousing  
- ETL Pipeline Development  
- Data Modeling  
- Analytics and Business Intelligence  

---

## Tools & Resources (Free)

- **Datasets**: ERP & CRM data (CSV)
- **SQL Server Express**: Lightweight SQL database server
- **SSMS** (SQL Server Management Studio): GUI for managing SQL Server
- **GitHub**: For code collaboration and version control

---

## Project Requirements

### Data Engineering Phase
- **Data Sources**: Ingest two datasets (ERP & CRM)
- **Data Quality**: Clean and prepare data
- **Integration**: Merge sources into a unified model
- **Modeling**: Create fact and dimension tables
- **Scope**: Focused on current data only (no historization)
- **Docs**: Provide clear documentation for the model

### Analytics Phase
- **Objective**: Use SQL to deliver insights around:
  - Customer behavior  
  - Product performance  
  - Sales trends
